# Coding Exercise

## Implementation

In the [code-sample](code-sample/) directory, implement the following:

1. Add a new route `/viewport` that contains the following:
  - The user's screen dimensions in pixels, in the format `width x height` (for
example `800 x 600`)
  - A link to `index.vue`
2. Modify `index.vue` to link to your new route.
