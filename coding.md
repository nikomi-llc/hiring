1. Add a new route `/viewport` that contains the following:
    - The user's screen dimensions in pixels, in the format `width x height` (for
example `800 x 600`)
    - A link to `index.vue`
2. Modify `index.vue` to add a link to your new route with the text
"Screen Size".

Style the pages in any way you wish.
